### Strengths of shaia/go-simd-bloomfilter

#### 1. Small Filter Performance (10K-100K elements)
**Array Mode Advantages:**
- **Zero allocations** per operation in array mode
- **1.34-1.50x faster** than willf for small filters
- **97 KB less allocation overhead** per 1000 operations
- Direct array indexing eliminates map lookup overhead

**Use Cases:**
- Microservices with many small filters
- Session/request-level filtering
- In-memory caches with high churn
- Real-time streaming with per-connection filters

#### 2. SIMD Acceleration
**Vector Operations:**
- PopCount: 2.91-4.25x faster than scalar
- VectorOr: 2.10-3.20x faster than scalar
- VectorAnd: 2.30-3.38x faster than scalar
- VectorClear: 1.70-4.62x faster than scalar

**Impact:**
- Bulk operations (Union, Intersection, Clear) significantly faster
- Better utilization of modern CPU capabilities (AVX2/AVX512)
- Scales with cache line size (64 bytes)

#### 3. Cache-Line Optimization
**Design:**
- Operations grouped by 64-byte cache lines
- Reduces cache misses during bit operations
- Better memory locality for related bits

**Benefits:**
- Improved L1/L2 cache hit rates
- Lower memory bandwidth consumption
- Better performance on high-frequency operations

#### 4. Hybrid Architecture
**Automatic Mode Selection:**
- Small filters (≤10K cache lines): Array mode
- Large filters (>10K cache lines): Map mode
- No user configuration required

**Advantages:**
- Optimal performance across all filter sizes
- Memory efficient for both extremes
- Future-proof for varying workloads

### Weaknesses of shaia/go-simd-bloomfilter

#### 1. Large Filter Performance (>1M elements)
**Map Mode Overhead:**
- 3.7-5.3x slower than willf for 1M+ element filters
- Map operations (144KB) vs simple bit array
- Cache line grouping adds overhead for sparse access patterns

**Root Causes:**
```
Per-operation breakdown (1M filter):
- Hash calculation: ~50-60 ns (both libraries)
- Cache line grouping: ~100-150 ns (shaia only)
- Map operations: ~200-250 ns (shaia only)
- Bit array access: ~20-30 ns (willf only)
Total: 483 ns (shaia) vs 102 ns (willf)
```

**Impact:**
- Not suitable for very large filters (>10M elements)
- Higher latency for high-throughput systems
- More CPU cycles per operation

#### 2. Memory Overhead for Large Filters
**Map Mode Allocations:**
- 144 bytes per operation (12,000 allocs per 1000 ops)
- 48% more allocations than willf (97KB vs 144KB)
- GC pressure increases with filter size

**Comparison:**
```
willf: Simple bit array, minimal per-op allocation
shaia: Map allocations for cache line grouping
```

#### 3. Complexity
**Implementation:**
- More complex codebase (hybrid modes, SIMD, cache optimization)
- Harder to maintain and debug
- Requires understanding of cache architecture

**Trade-offs:**
- Optimization complexity vs simplicity
- More moving parts = more potential issues
