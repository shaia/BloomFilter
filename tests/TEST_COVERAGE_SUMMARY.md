# BloomFilter Test Coverage Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive test suite covering unit tests, integration tests, stress tests, edge cases, and concurrency validation.

## Test Files Created/Enhanced

### 1. Unit Tests

#### `internal/hash/hash_test.go` (NEW)
**Coverage: 100%**

- **230+ test cases** covering both `Optimized1` and `Optimized2` hash functions
- Tests all code paths: 32-byte chunks, 8-byte chunks, remaining bytes
- Validates:
  - Deterministic behavior
  - Hash independence (two functions produce different hashes)
  - Collision resistance
  - Bit-flip sensitivity
  - Boundary conditions (7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 31, 32, 33, 63, 64, 65, 127, 128 bytes)
  - Edge cases (empty input, all zeros, all 0xFF, repeating patterns)

### 2. Integration Tests

#### `tests/integration/bloomfilter_stress_test.go` (REFACTORED)
**Large-scale stress testing and performance validation**

##### Large Dataset Tests
- `TestLargeDatasetInsertion`
  - Tests: 1M, 5M, 10M element insertions
  - Metrics: insertion rate, memory usage, verification rate
  - Verifies: all elements found, load factor, estimated FPP
  - Skip with `-short` flag for quick test runs

##### Performance Tests
- `TestHighThroughputSequential` - 1M sequential operations, measures insert/lookup rates
- `TestMemoryFootprintGrowth` - Tests memory usage across 10K to 10M element filters
- `TestLongRunningStability` - 10 cycles of add/verify operations

##### Edge Cases
- `TestExtremeEdgeCases`
  - Very small filters (overloaded 10x capacity)
  - Very long strings (1KB, 10KB, 100KB)
  - Empty and nil inputs
  - Extreme FPR values (0.0001 to 0.5)

#### `tests/integration/bloomfilter_concurrent_test.go` (NEW)
**Thread-safety validation (currently skipped due to known issues)**

- `TestConcurrentReads` - 100 goroutines √ó 1000 reads each
- `TestConcurrentWrites` - 50 goroutines √ó 1000 writes each
- `TestMixedConcurrentOperations` - 25 readers + 25 writers simultaneously

**IMPORTANT FINDING:** Concurrent read test discovered a nil pointer dereference in concurrent access scenarios, indicating thread-safety issue in the storage layer. All concurrent tests currently skip with documented reason.

#### `tests/integration/bloomfilter_edge_cases_test.go` (NEW)
**Boundary conditions and edge case validation**

##### Boundary Tests
- `TestBoundaryConditions`
  - Exact ArrayModeThreshold boundary
  - Cache line alignment (1, 63, 64, 65, 511, 512, 513, 1023, 1024, 1025 elements)
  - Bit and byte alignment (1-byte to 128-byte data sizes)

##### Hash Quality Tests
- `TestHashDistribution` - Validates hash distribution quality vs theoretical expectation
- `TestCollisionResistance` - Tests known collision-prone patterns
  - Sequential patterns
  - Repeating patterns (0xAA, 0x55, 0xFF)
  - Shifted patterns
  - Palindromes

##### FPR Tests
- `TestExtremeFalsePositiveRates`
  - Very low FPR (0.00001)
  - Low FPR (0.0001)
  - Normal FPR (0.01)
  - High FPR (0.1, 0.5)
  - Measures actual vs expected FPR

##### Edge Cases
- `TestZeroAndMinimalCases`
  - Zero uint64
  - Empty string vs nil slice
  - Single-bit patterns (all 8 single-bit values)

##### Memory Behavior
- `TestMemoryBehavior`
  - Multiple clear cycles (100 cycles √ó 100 elements)
  - Overload beyond capacity (10x elements)

##### Unicode & Special Characters
- `TestUnicodeAndSpecialCharacters`
  - Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese
  - Emojis
  - Control characters
  - Null bytes
  - Invalid UTF-8

#### `tests/integration/bloomfilter_race_test.go` (NEW)
**Race condition detection tests (requires `-race` flag and CGO)**

Build tag: `// +build race`

Tests concurrent operations to detect data races:
- `TestRaceConcurrentAdds` - Concurrent write operations
- `TestRaceConcurrentReads` - Concurrent read operations
- `TestRaceMixedReadWrite` - Simultaneous reads and writes
- `TestRacePopCount` - Concurrent PopCount calls
- `TestRaceClear` - Concurrent add/clear operations
- `TestRaceUnion` - Concurrent union operations
- `TestRaceIntersection` - Concurrent intersection operations
- `TestRaceGetCacheStats` - Concurrent stats reading
- `TestRaceMultipleOperations` - Various operations concurrently
- `TestRaceArrayVsMapMode` - Race tests for both storage modes

**Run with:** `go test -race ./tests/integration` (requires CGO_ENABLED=1)

## Coverage Summary

| Package | Coverage | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `internal/hash` | **100.0%** | Full coverage of both hash functions |
| Root package | **89.6%** | Core bloom filter operations |
| `internal/storage` | **98.3%** | Hybrid storage mode |
| `internal/simd` | **0.0%** | Assembly code (tested via integration) |
| `internal/simd/amd64` | **0.0%** | Assembly wrappers (tested via integration) |

**Note:** SIMD packages show 0% coverage because they contain assembly code and thin wrappers. They are thoroughly tested via integration tests.

### False Positive Rates

- Overloaded filters degrade gracefully
- No false negatives observed

### Concurrency

## Test Maintenance Notes

1. **Long-running tests** are skipped with `-short` flag for CI/CD
2. **Race tests** require CGO and may not run on all platforms
3. **Large dataset tests** have 5-10 minute timeout, adjust as needed
4. **Concurrent tests** are currently skipped due to known thread-safety issues

## Future Test Additions

Based on the comprehensive test suite added, these areas could benefit from additional coverage:

1. **Serialization** - Binary format save/load
2. **Migration** - Upgrading between versions
3. **Error Recovery** - Handling corrupted data
4. **Platform-Specific** - ARM64 NEON validation on actual ARM hardware
5. **Performance Regression** - Automated benchmark tracking
6. **Property-Based Testing** - Using `testing/quick` or similar
7. **Integration with Real Workloads** - Database-like usage patterns
